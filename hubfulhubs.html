                You, our Future User!</h1>


            <h2 style="font-size: 27PX !important;  font-weight: bolder;">From Personal Frustration by our Founder</h2>
            <p class="home-content">
                Our platform was actually created by HubFul.com’s own Founder and CEO, who has watched
                for years of companies taking advantage of their customers, as well as, from his own frustrations with
                trying to find something in his size (he stands 6’10”, 360+, with a Size 15 5E shoes), which never seems
                to really happen except at stores that are made for Big and Tall people like him. He was tired of having
                to go to these stores and spend nearly double what retailers were charging for "normal size clothes", so
                he has been working on getting the resources to build this company from the ground up, and is getting
                closer to getting it ready for launch! He has learned everything, and done everything, by himself.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 27PX !important; font-weight: bolder;">Built Outside the “Norm” Box</h3>
            <p class="home-content">
                From the very beginning, our Founder/CEO wanted to create something that no one else
                would be able to come close to and with him being an out-of-the-box thinker already, it was natural when
                the idea for this company came to him one day during class. From then on, he started researching
                everything he could, and when he couldn't find a single thing about the industry that he was thinking,
                he finally found a very small, but POWERFUL niche market. From there he started to break down each
                feature, each function, each tiny detail to build HubFul.com. What you will get to see is years-long
                dedication to fine tuning a website that you will EVER see! Nothing will ever come close to this
                Platform! EVER!
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 27PX !important; font-weight: bolder;">Account & Platform for All</h3>
            <p class="home-content">
                HubFul.com and our Account Types are designed to work flawlessly together to give you an
                experience like no other without the need for redirects outside of our Platform-as-a-Service.
                Think of HubFul as a Centralized Portal that protects you 24/7 and that learns more about you
                from simply sharing your likes and dislikes in regards to posts, shares, purchases and so much
                more that defines who you are!.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 27PX !important; font-weight: bolder;"> Beautifully Themed to Fit Your Style, Your
                Personality</h3>

            <p class="home-content">
                Your account will have a Default Theme Feature, that we build our accounts with, but if you don't like
                it, you won't hurt our feelings if you change it. That is what makes the HubFul Platform the most
                special platform that we never came across or will come close to, User Personalization that actually
                works since we are all different on the outside, but all the same (roughly) on the inside and that is
                what makes us all unique.

                Love to design Templates for fun or on the side? Feel free to contact us and we would love to showcase
                your beautiful theme to our entire userbase when they sign in everyday! Or you could just sell them
                right from your account! Among the many other things that you will be able to do with your account!

                <p class="home-content" style="font-size:28px; padding:15px;"> Have you ever pondered how businesses
                    see the reviews
                    that are available about them? Do they even ever read them?
                    Have you ever wondered whether they are genuinely concerned with or interested in the
                    reviews?
                    With our new review feature alone, companies will be able to see the reviews that customers are
                    leaving, as
                    well as, the chance to hear those customers and then implement changes within their companies to
                    fix issues that
                    customers are experiencing.
                    This allows companies to start listening to their customers again, like it should be!
